Exercise / assignments for Chapter 5 & 6 of Real World Cryptography, Secure transport & End 2 end encryption.

## exercise-01

> What is referred to as 'Secure transport protocols'?

A 'secure transport' protocol is designed to provide secure communications over a network. This is a abstract term for a lack of, as they can be constructed with a multitude of different cryptographic primitives and have many different uses. They include protocols such as TCP, HTTP, SSH, WPA, IPSEC, Noise, SSL or TLS, etc. The most mature and standardized 'secure transport' protocol is TLS.


## exercise-02

> Why do we need something such as TLS?

## exercise-03

> What is the difference between SSL and TLS?

SSL is a deprecated term as this was what it was first developed in 1995, then in 1999 of Janurary it was defined as TLS 1.0 in [RFC-2246](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2246)

## exercise-04

> Is version control a problem with these protocols? Why?
