Exercise / assignments 11 & 12 of Real World Cryptography, User authentication & Crypto as in cryptocurrency?


## exercise-01

> What is the goal of user authentication?

Allow services and applications to identify users based on unique parameters. For example, allowing a user to log in to a service and have personalization or permissions specific to their identity.

Another form of user authentication would be connecting to a SSH session with a webserver, to perform FTP. Only certain users can perform such an action to a server, which is why we need user authentication!

## exercise-02

> What is the difference between user authentication and data authentication?

## exercise-03

> what is the most common form of general user-authentication?

## exercise-04

> Name a few fundamental problems with passwords.


## exercise-05

> Could you think of a real world example of a Single-sign on?

The problem with 'single sign on' applications is that they have to reach a wide scale of adoption for them to be precedented or adopted by a mass user-base. So, services such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, etc can use a single sign on with much ease use, because well there has already been an assimilation and adoption for their service(s) by the general user-base.

Also, single-sign-on as mentioned above is typically an alternative to a conventional 'username and password' user authentication experience. An unprecedented application/protocol, in recent years is an application called Metamask, which acts as a web authentication wallet for signing messages, transactions and exchanging funds for the larger portion of Web3, which isn't an alternative; its the standard for user authentication for web3 applications. There is no need for users to assimilate as there was nothing to assimiliate for these type of applications in the first place!


## exercise-06

> What is an 'oblivious psuedorandom function'?

## exercise-07

> Why is cryptocurrency significant to cryptography or vice-versa?


## exercise-08

> Why are cryptographic gurantees so nessescary for blockchain & cryptocurrency applications?


## exercise-09

> Give a few reasons why cryptography development and research has been centered around cryptocurrencies in the last few years.

## exercise-10

> What is a merkle tree?


## exercise-11 

> Name a few implementations of ECDSA in blockchains.
